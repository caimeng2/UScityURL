# UScityURL

UScityURL is a complete collection of the official web addresses of all the 19518 municipalities in the US, including both big cities and small towns. A municipality or a broadly conceived city here is defined as a legally bounded entity with a local government, which is equivalent to an incorporated place in the US Census. Each entry of municipal web address was manually validated by two researchers who have expertise in urban and regional studies. Along with the dataset, we also provide instructions with ready-to-use Python code on how to use this dataset to systematically search municipal websites for keywords. This work provides easy access to a wealth of authoritative and up-to-date local data for systematic text-based analytics at the US national scale.
