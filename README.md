UScityURL is a complete and manually verified dataset containing information on whether a municipality has an official website and, if so, what its web address is, of all 19,518 municipalities in the United States. A municipality is defined as a legally bounded entity with a local government, which is equivalent to an incorporated place in the US Census. Each entry of municipal web address was manually validated by two researchers who have expertise in urban and regional studies.
